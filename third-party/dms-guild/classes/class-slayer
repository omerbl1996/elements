		<description>
			<p>The elf crouched down close to the dirty stone floor. She'd been told there was no way to track this beast, but she was no ordinary hunter. It had definitely come this way.</p>
			<p class="indent">Colored strings criss-crossed over the assortment of notes and documents covering the wall of the tiefling's study. He stood silently, fingers steepled in thought, before whispering to himself: "The coronation. He'll be posing as waitstaff. But so will I."</p>
			<p class="indent">The dwarf fled into the forest, panicked. He ran for several minutes before finally stopping to catch his breath and look around. There was no sign of his pursuer. Satisfied, he straightened up and smiled, then felt a blade in his back and the burning of poison throughout his body. He hit the ground without ever knowing who killed him.</p>
			<h4>THE HUNT IS ON</h4>
			<p>Adventurers take all sorts of approaches to staying ahead of the specter of death. Some meet their foes in open combat while others use tricks and illusions to manipulate circumstances to their advantage. Still others identify a threat, track it down, and slay it — this is the path of the slayer.</p>
			<p class="indent">Slayers are cunning warriors, using their wits to hunt their prey and take them out efficiently. Some hunt monsters in the wilderness, some slip poison into a noble's drink, and some stab you in the back without ever being seen. Whatever the method, a slayer knows where you've been and where you're going, and has no intention of fighting fair.</p>
			<h4>GRIM TRACKERS</h4>
			<p>Slayers don't always have a shiny reputation. They have no sparkly magic tricks to impress people, and no gleaming armor covered in medals of valor. Their work is deadly and efficient, which can often lead others to look at them as amoral assassins.</p>
			<p class="indent">While this certainly does describe some slayers, others are just as heroic as any storied warrior — they've just chosen a more pragmatic method of operation. They might hunt down monsters or wanted fugitives to keep people safe, or they might serve as a scout and bodyguard for a noble whose work they believe in.</p>
            <p class="indent">The common thread among slayers is not their motives, but their methods. Whether for selfish or altruistic reasons, a slayer chooses a target and can track them nearly anywhere. Once the slayer catches up with their quarry, they strike with focused determination.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A SLAYER </h4>
			<p>As you prepare to make your slayer character, consider what might drive them to choose such a path. Are they simply a very cautious adventurer, avoiding unnecessary risks by always trying to have the upper hand against monsters? Do they have a morbid fascination with poisons? Perhaps they hunt down criminals in pursuit of vigilante justice, or maybe they hunt monsters for money because they feel like that's the only thing they're good at?</p>
			<p class="indent">Once your character learned the first abilities of being a slayer, what motivated them to become an adventurer and join a party? Do they have an attachment to one of their party members? Is it a matter of practicality, wanting to have a group of allies for those times when sneaking up on your enemy isn't feasible? Or perhaps it was the only job they could find at the moment, or they were otherwise forced into an adventuring group by circumstance?</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
